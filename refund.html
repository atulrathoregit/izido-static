        <h2>Cancellation & Refund Policy</h2>
        <p>BORD MEDIA PRIVATE LIMITED believes in helping its customers as far as possible, and has therefore a liberal cancellation policy. Under this policy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The cancellation request may not be entertained if the orders has been done in the system and the process has been initiated.</li>
            <li>In case of anything problematic please report the same to our Customer Service team. The request will, however, be entertained once the merchant has checked and determined the same at his own end. This should be reported within same day of ad/contest. The Customer Service Team after looking into your complaint will take an appropriate decision.</li>
            <li>In case of any Refunds approved by the BORD MEDIA PRIVATE LIMITED, itâ€™ll take 16-30 Days days for the refund to be processed to the end customer.</li>
        </ul>
