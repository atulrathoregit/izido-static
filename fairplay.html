            Izido is committed towards ensuring that no unfair gameplay
            practices are occurring in the contest. These include, but are not

          <ul>
            <li>
              <span class="fw-bold">Collusion</span> occurs when two or more
              players are playing in same contest and share and use that
              knowledge to abuse / manipulate the contest in order to win money
              from other players in the contest.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="fw-bold">Contest Dumping</span> occurs when players
              deliberately lose quiz in order to transfer money to few
              contestants only.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="fw-bold">Multiple Accounts:</span> Players are
              forbidden from opening / gaining access to accounts in their
              family member or friends’ name. Players are also not allowed to

            <li>
              <span class="fw-bold">IP Ghosting</span> involves a player

              geo-location multiple times during a quiz without prior
              authorization from izido.

            <li>
              <span class="fw-bold">Software Modifications:</span> Players are

              Players are not allowed to use external software that provides
              them with an unfair advantage during the quiz. This includes the

              strategies. These programs read the information on question,
              compute actions to perform based on the defined strategy and
              perform the action automatically without the active involvement of
              the player in each quiz.

              <span class="fw-bold">RTAs:</span> RTAs are extremely powerful

              poker application, run a simulation and tell the best play in
              real-time. Such RTA tools are extremely powerful as they provide

              Izido's internal surveillance team is always on hand to ensure
              that no unauthorized or illegal account gets access to the system
              i.e no unauthorized person gets access to or can influence
              gameplay or our software to gain an unfair advantage.
            </li>
            <li>
              All hands that are played on the platform are encrypted i.e. no
              one, including us, can see what hand you have been dealt until the
              end of the hand.
            </li>
            <li>
              Every single hand that has been played on Izido since its
              beginning contains a unique ID which can be used to retrieve and
              review the information for any hand of concern.
            </li>
            <li>
              Your login password is encrypted and only accessible to you - no
              one, including Izido employees are able to view or have knowledge
              of your password.
            </li>
            <li>
              Our surveillance team conducts regular automated checks by
              creating fraud risk scores for all players.
            </li>
            <li>
              While running the Izido app, players are not allowed to use
              unauthorized applications which may help them gain an unfair

            <h5>Unfair Gameplay Practices</h5>
            <p>Izido is committed towards ensuring that no unfair gameplay practices are occurring in the contest. These include, but are not limited to: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span class="fw-bold">Collusion</span> occurs when two or more players are playing in same contest and share and use that knowledge to abuse / manipulate the contest in order to win money from other players in the contest. </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="fw-bold">Contest Dumping</span> occurs when players deliberately lose quiz in order to transfer money to few contestants only. </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="fw-bold">Multiple Accounts:</span> Players are forbidden from opening / gaining access to accounts in their family member or friends’ name. Players are also not allowed to give access to their account to another player. </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="fw-bold">IP Ghosting</span> involves a player attempting to change their Internet Protocol (IP) address or geo-location multiple times during a game without prior authorization from izido. </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="fw-bold">Software Modifications:</span> Players are not allowed to reverse-engineer, decompile, modify or disassemble the izido software in any way. </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="fw-bold">External Player Assistance Programs:</span> Players are not allowed to use external software that provides them with an unfair advantage during the game. This includes the use of artificial intelligence [robots] programs, such as but not limited to: </li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="mx-4">
                <li>
                    <span class="fw-bold">Bots: </span>Bots are programs that perform automated actions on behalf of the player using predefined strategies. These programs read the information on question, compute actions to perform based on the defined strategy and perform the action automatically without the active involvement of the player in each hand. Since bots are not subject to human emotions and fatigue, they create an unfair situation for human players even if their employed strategy is inferior. </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="fw-bold">RTAs: </span>RTAs are extremely powerful tools that can extract all information about an active hand from a poker application, run a simulation and tell the best play in real-time. Such RTA tools are extremely powerful as they provide solver solutions to players while they are playing poker, making them basically unbeatable. Even if other players know that a particular player is using these tools, it would be extremely hard to play against that player as RTAs make plays that are impossible to exploit. Players using any RTA tool will have a massive edge, therefore deeming it to be foul play and cheating.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Securing the Quiz</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Izido's internal surveillance team is always on hand to ensure that no unauthorized or illegal account gets access to the system i.e no unauthorised person gets access to or can influence gameplay or or our software to gain an unfair advantage. </li>
                <li>All hands that are played on the platform are encrypted i.e. no one, including us, can see what hand you have been dealt until the end of the hand.</li>
                <li>Every single hand that has been played on Izido since its beginning contains a unique ID which can be used to retrieve and review the information for any hand of concern. Players can reach out support@izido.io with the ID or date and tournament details for the relevant information.</li>
                <li>Your login password is encrypted and only accessible to you - no one, including Izido employees are able to view or have knowledge of your password. </li>
                <li>Our surveillance team conducts regular automated checks by creating fraud risk scores for all players. The scores are created based on a player's gameplay activity to detect unfair gameplay practices such as deployment of bots, usage of RTAs or other unauthorized applications that give players an unfair advantage. We use advanced data analytics to identify sudden deviations in gameplay patterns of players, who have to undergo additional surveillance checks to ensure a safe and fun gaming environment.</li>
                <li>While running the Izido app, players are not allowed to use unauthorized applications which may help them gain an unfair advantage.</li>
