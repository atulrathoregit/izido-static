                                    <li>
                                        <span class="fw-bold">Collusion</span> occurs when two or more players are playing in same contest and share and use that knowledge to abuse / manipulate the contest in order to win money from other players in the contest. </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span class="fw-bold">Contest Dumping</span> occurs when players deliberately lose quiz in order to transfer money to few contestants only. </li>

                                        <span class="fw-bold">Multiple Accounts:</span> Players are forbidden from opening / gaining access to accounts in their family member or friends’ name. Players are also not allowed to give access to their account to another player. </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span class="fw-bold">IP Ghosting</span> involves a player attempting to change their Internet Protocol (IP) address or geo-location multiple times during a game without prior authorization from izido. </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span class="fw-bold">Software Modifications:</span> Players are not allowed to reverse-engineer, decompile, modify or disassemble the izido software in any way. </li>

This includes the use of artificial intelligence [robots] programs, such as but not limited to: </li>
                                </ul>

                                        <span class="fw-bold">Bots: </span>Bots are programs that perform automated actions on behalf of the player using predefined strategies. These programs read the information on question, compute actions to perform based on the defined strategy and perform the action automatically without the active involvement of the player in each hand. Since bots are not subject to human emotions and fatigue, they create an unfair situation for human players even if their employed strategy is inferior. </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span class="fw-bold">RTAs: </span>RTAs are extremely powerful tools that can extract all information about an active hand from a poker application, run a simulation and tell the best play in real-time. Such RTA tools are extremely powerful as they provide solver solutions to players while they are playing poker, making them basically unbeatable. Even if other players know that a particular player is using these tools, it would be extremely hard to play against that player as RTAs make plays that are impossible to exploit. Players using any RTA tool will have a massive edge, therefore deeming it to be foul play and cheating.</li>
