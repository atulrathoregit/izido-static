            <p>The payment made by participants to enter the quiz contest includes the platform fee for accessing IZIDO Quiz,<span> Government mandated taxes/ duties/ charges </span>and the participant's contribution towards the prize money pool. </p>
            <p>All amounts collected from participants are held in a separate non-interest-earning bank account operated by a third party appointed by IZIDO Quiz. These funds are used for payouts to participants, IZIDO Quiz (for platform fees), and the government (for TDS on winnings). </p>

            <p>Participants have two categories of accounts: unutilized account and winnings account. Winnings from a contest are credited to the winnings account, while amounts remitted through the payment gateway are credited to the unutilized account. </p>
            <p>Each time a participant joins a quiz, the pre-designated amount is debited from the unutilized account first, and any remaining amount is then debited from the winnings account. </p>

            <p>IZIDO Quiz may issue Cash Bonus to participants for promotional activities, which can be used for setting off against the contribution to the prize pool. Cash Bonus is non-transferable and cannot be withdrawn. </p>
            <p>All Cash Bonus credited to a participant's account is valid for 14 days from the date of credit.</p>
            <p>Transactions on IZIDO Quiz may take up to 24 hours to be processed, and participants agree not to raise any complaints against IZIDO Quiz for any delays. </p>
